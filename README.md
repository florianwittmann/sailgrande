* A startpage containing a preview for all three of them (own feed, popular and tag posts)
* Show details for a picture/video : Count of likes and comments and the most recent comments.
* Watch videos
* Like a picture/video or remove your previous like
* Open user profiles

There is no commenting and there is no upload feature yet.
